<p align="left"> <b> Inequality: </b> </p> 
 
 Others are not treated right maybe because of their physical appearance, gender and many more. No matter who we are, we need to be treated nicely. And treat those people base on how they treat us. Its a matter of give and take. 
 
 <p align="left"> <b> Climate Change:  </b> </p>
 
 Weather, can be linked to poverty, in an aspect of drought. During drought we dont have enough water to drink, thats the cause why we are losing weight. Next thing is that weather affects our health, as well. 
 
 <p align="left"> <b> Lack of Government: </b> </p>
 
 Support- Sometimes government officials didnt manage the budget well, they are more on their underground activities, that results to hunger of every people.
 
 <p align="left"> <b> Rationale: </b> </p>
 Poverty is commonly experienced by many people. It is a condition where members of the household don't meet their needs. Poverty is bluntly spreading, sociallyconstructed and well defined. Individuals' efforts for escaping poverty are completely linked to the socially constructed categories of poverty they face. We are unable to comprehend local people's strategies and goals because we lack the machinery to understand poverty as they view it. We are unable to fully assist their actions because we are unable to perceive what they are doing on their own.
 
 <p align="left"> <b> Solutions: </b> </p>
 
  <p align="left"> <b> 1) Education </b> </p>
 Education is one of the solution to poverty. Finishing your education is important because you can have employment option with a big salary on it. The cycle of poverty persists without education.
 
 <p align="left"> <b> 2) Creating Jobs </b> </p>
 When people have jobs then they have income. You can pull out your selves from poverty when you have income or money. 
 
<p align="left"> <b> 3) Increasing wages </b> </p>
 Lack of income is also the problem of the poverty. Others cannot buy their necessities because of the small amount of money. They can afford to raise their family in poverty if the Government will be increasing the wages of every employee.
 
 <p align="left"> <b> 4) Hardworking </b> </p>
 Diligence may get you out of poverty. You can have anything you want because of your hard work. Intelligent is really not important as long as you are hardworking.
 
  <p align="left"> <b> 5) Child Participation </b> </p>
 Children will be prioritize of everything. It helps children to express their views and make the right decision for their future. Youth are the hope of this country.
 
  <p align="left"> <b> Prayer and Acknowlegments: </b> </p>
 Father God who art in heaven, thank you for making me strong despite of hunger other people experience. Guide me if Im too much. May you hear every cries of each of your child. May you provide them what they need. Give them enough shelter to spend a night with. May you lessen those who treat them equally and help them to be treated right. Enlighten the minds of each and every people about the importance of education so they are aware and they wouldnt commit the same mistake. Make people understand and be open-minded about the situation we are facing right now that they shouldnt be selfish Guide the weather accordingly so that your children wont suffer. Guide the government officials with wisdom so that they can provide every needs of the people they surrounded with. This we ask this in your mighty name, Amen
