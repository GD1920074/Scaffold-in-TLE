 <br>
Background of the issue:
 <br>
 <br>
Lack of Education- The link between poverty and lack of education is a research topic increasingly more common in the last decade Those born in poverty, are less prepared or not prepared at all for the school, this practically represents a failure compared to other children from primary school. This leads to the inability to integrate.

 <br>
 Inequality- Others are not treated right maybe because of their physical appearance, gender and many more. No matter who we are, we need to be treated nicely. And treat those people base on how they treat us. It’s a matter of give and take. 
<br>
 Climate Change:  Weather, can be linked to poverty, in an aspect of drought. During drought we don’t have enough water to drink, that’s the cause why we’re losing weight. Next thing is that weather affects our health, as well. 
<br>
 Lack of Government: Support- Sometimes government officials didn’t manage the budget well, they’re more on their underground activities, that results to hunger of every people.
