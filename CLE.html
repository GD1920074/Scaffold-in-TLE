 <br>
Background of the issue:
 
 <br>
 <br>
 
Lack of Education- The link between poverty and lack of education is a research topic increasingly more common in the last decade Those born in poverty, are less prepared or not prepared at all for the school, this practically represents a failure compared to other children from primary school. This leads to the inability to integrate.

Inequality- Others are not treated right maybe because of their physical appearance, gender and many more. No matter who we are, we need to be treated nicely. And treat those people base on how they treat us. Its a matter of give and take. 

 <br>
 
 Climate Change:  Weather, can be linked to poverty, in an aspect of drought. During drought we dont have enough water to drink, thats the cause why we are losing weight. Next thing is that weather affects our health, as well. 
 
 <br>

 <p align="left"> <b> Rationale: </b> </p>
 
 Poverty is commonly experienced by many people. It is a condition where members of the household don't meet their needs. Poverty is bluntly spreading, sociallyconstructed and well defined. Individuals' efforts for escaping poverty are completely linked to the socially constructed categories of poverty they face. We are unable to comprehend local people's strategies and goals because we lack the machinery to understand poverty as they view it. We are unable to fully assist their actions because we are unable to perceive what they are doing on their own.
